# SELYYoutubeProject
Conducting an analysis on number of fitness-related youtube videos accessible to persons with disabilities, and whether COVID-19 influenced the amount of videos made for/that include accommodations for persons with disabilities. Measuring accessibility based on three parameters: whether the videos have subtitles or not, if the videos are in top 100 videos when certain term is searched, and if the video content accommodates for persons with disabilities. I gathered data about Youtube videos (video title, transcription, video tags, video description, etc) and did an analysis using Python, the Youtube Data API, and Microsoft Excel. Currently preparing paper for publication.
